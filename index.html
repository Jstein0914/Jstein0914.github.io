  <h1>Jeff Stein</h1>
  <h2>IT Project Management</h2>

  <p>
    My plan is to first earn a degree in Computer Applications from Texas Tech, followed by a masters degree in project management. A background in Computer Applications enhances my problem-solving abilities, improves my capability in creating technical documentation, and provides me with the valuable experience for managing technical projects as a Project Manager.
  <p>
    As I pursue a career as an IT Project Manager, having a foundational knowledge of Computer Applications will enable me to effectively collaborate with developers and other project stakeholders.
